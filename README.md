In this repository I shared my Oasis-Infobyte internship tasks

Task 1 : Created a BMI calculator in Python. Prompt users for their weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters). Calculate the BMI and classify it into categories (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight) based on predefined ranges. Display the BMI result and category to the user.

Task 2 : Created a password generator in Python that generates random passwords based on user-defined criteria, such as length and character types (letters, numbers, symbols). Allow users to specify password length and character set preferences.

Task 3 : Created a weather app in Python that fetches and displays current weather data for a user-specified location (e.g., city or ZIP code) using a weather API. Show basic information such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.
